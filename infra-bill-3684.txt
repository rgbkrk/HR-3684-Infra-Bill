                described in subparagraph (A) merits the continuation 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) recently, the disparities cause by 
                discrimination against African American, Hispanic 
                American, Asian American, Native American, and women 
                business owners have been further exacerbated by the 
                coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate effects 
                on minority- and women-owned businesses across the 
                nation;
                    (D) Congress has received and reviewed testimony 
                and documentation of race and gender discrimination 
                from numerous sources, including congressional hearings 
                and other investigative activities, scientific reports, 
                reports issued by public and private agencies at every 
                level of government, news reports, academic 
                publications, reports of discrimination by 
                organizations and individuals, and discrimination 
                lawsuits, which continue to demonstrate that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
                address the problem;
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (D) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses an injurious and enduring 
                barrier to full and fair participation in surface 
                transportation-related businesses of women business 
                owners and minority business owners and has negatively 
                affected firm formation, development and success in 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (F) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (D) provide a clear picture of the 
                inequality caused by discrimination that continues to 
                plague our nation and a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.
            (2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following 
        definitions apply:
                    (A) Small business concern.--The term ``small 
                business concern'' means a small business concern (as 
                the term is used in section 3 of the Small Business Act 
                (15 U.S.C. 632)).
                    (B) Socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals.--The term ``socially and economically 
                disadvantaged individuals'' has the meaning given the 
                term in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 
                U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations 
                issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be 
                presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals for purposes of this subsection.
            (3) Amounts for small business concerns.--Except to the 
        extent that the Secretary of Transportation determines 
        otherwise, not less than 10 percent of the amounts made 
        available for any program under titles I, II, V, and VII of 
        this division and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, 
        shall be expended through small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals.
            (4) Annual listing of disadvantaged business enterprises.--
        Each State shall annually--
                    (A) survey and compile a list of the small business 
                concerns referred to in paragraph (3) in the State, 
                including the location of the small business concerns 
                in the State; and
                    (B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the 
                percentage of the small business concerns that are 
                controlled by--
                            (i) women;
                            (ii) socially and economically 
                        disadvantaged individuals (other than women); 
                        and
                            (iii) individuals who are women and are 
                        otherwise socially and economically 
                        disadvantaged individuals.
            (5) Uniform certification.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation 
                shall establish minimum uniform criteria for use by 
                State governments in certifying whether a concern 
                qualifies as a small business concern for the purpose 
                of this subsection.
                    (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria 
                established under subparagraph (A) shall include, with 
                respect to a potential small business concern--
                            (i) on-site visits;
                            (ii) personal interviews with personnel;
                            (iii) issuance or inspection of licenses;
                            (iv) analyses of stock ownership;
                            (v) listings of equipment;
                            (vi) analyses of bonding capacity;
                            (vii) listings of work completed;
                            (viii) examination of the resumes of 
                        principal owners;
                            (ix) analyses of financial capacity; and
                            (x) analyses of the type of work preferred.
            (6) Reporting.--The Secretary of Transportation shall 
        establish minimum requirements for use by State governments in 
        reporting to the Secretary--
                    (A) information concerning disadvantaged business 
                enterprise awards, commitments, and achievements; and
                    (B) such other information as the Secretary 
                determines to be appropriate for the proper monitoring 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this 
        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to 
        receive funds made available under titles I, II, V, and VII of 
        this division and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, 
        if the entity or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from 
        complying with paragraph (3) because a Federal court issues a 
        final order in which the court finds that a requirement or the 
        implementation of paragraph (3) is unconstitutional.
            (8) Sense of congress on prompt payment of dbe 
        subcontractors.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) the Secretary of Transportation should take 
                additional steps to ensure that recipients comply with 
                section 26.29 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations 
                (the disadvantaged business enterprises prompt payment 
                rule), or any corresponding regulation, in awarding 
                federally funded transportation contracts under laws 
                and regulations administered by the Secretary; and
                    (B) such additional steps should include increasing 
                the Department of Transportation's ability to track and 
                keep records of complaints and to make that information 
                publicly available.
            (9) Sense of congress on fulfilling certain contracts.--It 
        is the sense of Congress that contractors participating in a 
        federally funded transportation contract with a small business 
        concern owned and controlled by socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals should ensure that the percentage of 
        a contract promised to such small business concern is 
        fulfilled, unless prior approval is obtained consistent with 
        the regulations under part 26 of title 49, Code of Federal 
        Regulations.
    (d) Limitation on Financial Assistance for State-Owned 
Enterprises.--
            (1) In general.--Funds provided under this section may not 
        be used in awarding or exercising an option on a previously 
        awarded contract, a contract, subcontract, grant, or loan to an 
        entity that is owned or controlled by, is a subsidiary of, or 
        is otherwise related legally or financially to a corporation 
        based in a country that--
                    (A) is identified as a nonmarket economy country 
                (as defined in section 771(18) of the Tariff Act of

                of this Act;
                    (B) was identified by the United States Trade 
                Representative in the most recent report required by 
                section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242) 
                as a priority foreign country under subsection (a)(2) 
                of that section; and
                    (C) is subject to monitoring by the Trade 
                Representative under section 306 of the Trade Act of 
                1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416).
            (2) Exception.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the term 
        ``otherwise related legally or financially'' does not include a 
        minority relationship or investment.
            (3) International agreements.--This subsection shall be 
        applied in a manner consistent with the obligations of the 
        United States under international agreements.

                                amount referred to in subsection 
                                (b)(15) for the fiscal year; less

        under paragraphs (1) and (2) and the amounts distributed under 
        paragraph (4), for Federal-aid highway and highway safety 
        construction programs that are apportioned by the Secretary

                                conduit redundant with a dig once 
                                requirement of a local government or 
                                Indian tribe;
                                    (VI) there exists a circumstance 
                                involving force majeure; or
                                    (VII) the installation of conduit 
                                is not appropriate based on other 
                                relevant factors established by the 
                                Secretary in consultation with the NTIA

                        of road, rurality, and other factors; and

    (d) Considerations.--In carrying out the study, the Transportation 
Research Board shall determine the need for information related to 
climate resilient transportation infrastructure by considering--
            (1) the current informational and institutional barriers to 
        integrating projected infrastructure risks posed by climate 
        change into federal infrastructure planning, design, 
        engineering, construction, operation and maintenance;
            (2) the critical information needed by engineers, planners 
        and those charged with infrastructure upgrades and maintenance 
        to better incorporate climate change risks and impacts over the 
        lifetime of projects;
            (3) how to select an appropriate, adaptive engineering 
        design for a range of future climate scenarios as related to 
        infrastructure planning and investment;
            (4) how to incentivize and incorporate systems thinking 
        into engineering design to maximize the benefits of multiple 
        natural functions and emissions reduction, as well as regional 
        planning;
            (5) how to take account of the risks of cascading 
        infrastructure failures and develop more holistic approaches to 
        evaluating and mitigating climate risks;
            (6) how to ensure that investments in infrastructure 
        resilience benefit all communities, including communities of 
        color, low-income communities, residents of public housing (as 
        such term is defined in section 3(b) of the United States 
        Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)) and of other housing 
        assisted under other Federal affordable housing programs as so 
        designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 
        and Indian Tribes that face a disproportionate risk from 
        climate change and in many cases have experienced long-standing 
        unmet needs and underinvestment in critical infrastructure;
            (7) how to incorporate capital assessment and planning 
        training and techniques, including a range of financing options 
        to help local and State governments plan for and provide 
        matching funds;
            (8) how federal agencies can track and monitor federally 
        funded resilient infrastructure in a coordinated fashion to 
        help build the understanding of the cost-benefit of resilient 
        infrastructure and to build the capacity for implementing 
        resilient infrastructure; and
            (9) the occupations, skillsets, training programs, 
        competencies and recognized postsecondary credentials that will 
        be needed to implement such climate-resilient transportation 
        infrastructure projects, and how to ensure that any new jobs 
        created by such projects ensure that priority hiring 
        considerations are given to individuals facing barriers to 
        employment, including individuals registered with a one-stop 
        center, as defined under section 3 of the Workforce Innovation 
        and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102), communities of color, 
        low-income communities, residents of public housing (as such 
        term is defined in section 3(b) of the United States Housing 
        Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)) and of other housing assisted 
        under other Federal affordable housing programs as so 
        designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit 
to Congress a report on broadband service in Federally-assisted 
housing.
    (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) an analysis of Federally-assisted housing units that

        State, county, and congressional district, that includes 
        geographic information and any Federal agency responsible for 
        such units;
            (2) an analysis of which such units are not currently 
        capable of supporting broadband service deployment and would 
        require retrofitting to support broadband service deployment, 
        disaggregated by State, county, and congressional district, 
        that includes geographic information and any Federal agency 
        responsible for such units;
            (3) an analysis of the estimated costs and timeframe 
        necessary for retrofitting buildings to achieve 100 percent 
        access to broadband service;
            (4) an analysis of the challenges to more widespread 
        deployment of broadband service, including the comparative 
        markets dynamics to expansion in rural areas and low-income 
        urban areas, and the challenges to pursuing retrofits to 
        achieve 100 percent access to broadband service;
            (5) descriptions of lessons learned from previous 
        retrofitting actions;
            (6) an evaluation of the ConnectHome pilot program of the 
        Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and
            (7) recommendations for Congress for achieving 100 percent 
        access to broadband service in Federally-assisted housing.

            (2) Federally-assisted housing.--In this section, the term

                for the purchase of goods and services;

SEC. 2608. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ELECTRIC VEHICLE TRANSITION 
              STRATEGY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The transition to a modern electric fleet managed by 
        the nation's transit agencies represents a key opportunity to 
        modernize and green the public transit fleets.
            (2) The impending fleet transition presents difficult 
        workforce challenges for the transit agencies and their 
        frontline workers as they prepare for the differences in 
        purchasing, maintaining, and managing new electric buses and 
        the related maintenance systems.
            (3) The maintenance of electric engines requires fewer 
        mechanics than does the maintenance of diesel and natural gas 
        engines, which make up more than 99 percent of bus fleets in 
        the United States.
            (4) Although approximately 400,000 people work in public 
        transportation, and of that figure, 90 percent work in the 
        frontline occupations, because of retirements and a massive 
        transition in the transit workforce, large changes are bound 
        for workers, transit agencies, and the communities that the 
        transit workforce serves.
            (5) Based on the Department of Transportation and the 
        Department of Labor data from 2014, transit systems needed to 
        hire, train, and retain approximately 126 percent of their 
        workforce over a 10-year period.
            (6) The Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad 
        Administration, and sister Federal agencies like the Department 
        of Energy and the Department of Labor can offer resources, 
        strategy, and a research and development plan to prepare and 
        assist in the upcoming transition to electric and clean vehicle 
        systems.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
transit industry needs an integrated, cooperative, and forward-looking 
workforce development strategy in order to help frontline workers and 
the transit agencies prepare for and mitigate the workforce disruption 
challenges posed by the transition to electric vehicles and electric 
buses.

SEC. 2805. NATIONAL ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSIT BUS DEVELOPMENT 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Transportation shall establish 
a national advanced technology transit bus development program to 
facilitate the development and testing of commercially viable advanced 
technology transit buses that do not exceed a Level 3 automated driving 
system and related infrastructure.
    (b) Authorization.--There shall be available $20,000,000 for each 
of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.
    (c) Grants.--The Secretary may enter into grants, contracts, and 
cooperative agreements with no more than three geographically diverse 
nonprofit organizations and recipients under chapter 53 of title 49, 
United States Code, to facilitate the development and testing of 
commercially viable advance technology transit buses and related 
infrastructure.
    (d) Considerations.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall consider the 
        applicant's--
                    (A) ability to contribute significantly to 
                furthering advanced technologies as it relates to 
                transit bus operations, including advanced driver 
                assistance systems, automatic emergency braking, 
                accessibility, and energy efficiency;
                    (B) financing plan and cost share potential;
                    (C) technical experience developing or testing 
                advanced technologies in transit buses;
                    (D) commitment to frontline worker involvement; and
                    (E) other criteria that the Secretary determines 
                are necessary to carry out the program.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may 
        be construed to allow the Secretary to waive any requirement 
        under any other provision of Federal law.
    (e) Competitive Grant Selection.--The Secretary shall conduct a 
national solicitation for applications for grants under the program. 
Grant recipients shall be selected on a competitive basis. The 
Secretary shall give priority consideration to applicants that have 
successfully managed advanced transportation technology projects, 
including projects related to public transportation operations for a 
period of not less than 5 years.
    (f) Consortia.--As a condition of receiving an award in (c), the 
Secretary shall ensure--
            (1) that the selected non-profit recipients subsequently 
        establish a consortia for each proposal submitted, including 
        representatives from a labor union, transit agency, an FTA-
        designated university bus and component testing center, a Buy 
        America compliant transit bus manufacturer, and others as 
        determined by the Secretary;
            (2) that no proposal selected would decrease workplace or 
        passenger safety; and
            (3) that no proposal selected would undermine the creation 
        of high-quality jobs or workforce support and development 
        programs.
    (g) Federal Share.--The Federal share of costs of the program shall 
be provided from funds made available to carry out this section. The 
Federal share of the cost of a project carried out under the program 
shall not exceed 80 percent of such cost.

SEC. 2806. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INNOVATION.

    Section 5312(h)(2) of title 49, United States Code, is amended by 
striking subparagraph (G).

SEC. 2807. TRANSIT VEHICLE BATTERY RECYCLING AND REUSE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations 
that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, allow recipients of 
funds under chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, at the option 
of the recipient, to repurpose, recycle, reuse, sell, or lease transit 
vehicle batteries that are beyond the useful service life of such 
batteries for the purpose of transit vehicle propulsion and component 
parts of such batteries.
    (b) Considerations.--In issuing regulations under subsection (a), 
the Secretary shall prioritize second life applications that--
            (1) maximize the full use of transit vehicle batteries 
        beyond the useful life of such batteries for transit vehicle 
        propulsion and component parts of such batteries;
            (2) enhance the reuse and recycling of transit vehicle 
        batteries, components, and component critical minerals of such 
        batteries;
            (3) reduce costs for recipients;
            (4) create new streams of revenue for recipients;
            (5) support the provision of zero emission public 
        transportation service, which may include the use of wayside 
        charging; and
            (6) enhance the resilience of public transportation and the 
        electric vehicle supply equipment network, which may include 
        the use of batteries for energy storage.
    (c) Second Life Applications Defined.--In this section, the term 
``second life applications'' means the repurposing, recycling, reuse, 
sale, or leasing of a transit vehicle battery that is beyond the useful 
service life for the purpose of transit vehicle propulsion and 
component parts of such battery, but that retains utility for other 
applications.

SEC. 3017. IMPAIRED DRIVING COUNTERMEASURE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a priority should be placed on creating State systems, 
        programs, and processes that improve impaired driving detection 
        in cases in which alcohol, drugs, and especially multiple 
        substances are involved;
            (2) States and communities should have access to a broader 
        range of countermeasures, technologies, and resources to 
        address multiple substance impaired driving; and
            (3) increased Federal funding should be made available for 
        efforts to improve public safety through the approaches 
        described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase national 
investment in, and maximize the use of, innovative programs and 
technologies to eliminate multiple substance impaired driving.

                        provide an equivalent level of safety as would 
                        exist in the absence of exemptions, waivers, or

                service;

    (n) Limitation on Financial Assistance for State-Owned 
Enterprises.--
            (1) In general.--Funds provided under this section and the 
        amendments made by this section may not be used in awarding a 
        contract, subcontract, grant, or loan to an entity that is 
        owned or controlled by, is a subsidiary of, or is otherwise 
        related legally or financially to a corporation based in a 
        country that--
                    (A) is identified as a nonmarket economy country 
                (as defined in section 771(18) of the Tariff Act of 
                1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18))) as of the date of enactment 
                of this Act;
                    (B) was identified by the United States Trade 
                Representative in the most recent report required by 
                section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242) 
                as a priority foreign country under subsection (a)(2) 
                of that section; and
                    (C) is subject to monitoring by the Trade 
                Representative under section 306 of the Trade Act of 
                1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416).
            (2) Exception.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the term

        minority relationship or investment.
            (3) International agreements.--This subsection shall be 
        applied in a manner consistent with the obligations of the 
        United States under international agreements.
    (o) Rail Trust Fund.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Funding.--Beginning on the date on which a rail 
                trust fund is established, any amounts made available 
                under subsections (a), (g), (h), (i), (j)(1), (k), and 
                (l) shall be derived from such fund.
                    (B) Rail trust fund defined.--In this subsection, 
                the term ``rail trust fund'' means a trust fund 
                established under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for 
                making certain expenditures for the benefit of rail and 
                for crediting certain taxes and penalties collected 
                relating to rail.
            (2) Sense of committee on need for rail trust fund.--The 
        following is the sense of the Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure of the House of Representatives:
                    (A) There is a discrepancy in historical Federal 
                investment between highways, aviation, and intercity 
                passenger rail. Between 1949 and 2017, the Federal 
                Government invested more than $2 trillion in our 
                nation's highways and over $777 billion in aviation. 
                The Federal Government has invested $96 billion in 
                intercity passenger rail, beginning in 1971 with the 
                creation of the National Railroad Passenger 
                Corporation. Intercity passenger rail Federal 
                investment is only 12 percent of Federal aviation 
                investment and less than 5 percent of Federal highway 
                investment.
                    (B) Congress has recognized the value and 
                importance of a predictable, dedicated funding source 
                through a trust fund for all other modes of 
                transportation including for aviation, highways, 
                transit, and waterways. The Highway Trust Fund was 
                created in 1956. The Airport and Aviation Trust Fund 
                was created in 1970. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund 
                was created in 1978. Mass transit was added to the 
                Highway Trust Fund in 1983. The Harbor Maintenance 
                Trust Fund was created in 1986. With regard to Federal 
                transportation investment, only intercity passenger and 
                freight rail do not have a predictable, dedicated 
                funding source through a trust fund.
                    (C) The Federal Railroad Administration has 
                identified more than $300 billion worth of investment 
                needed to develop both high-speed and higher speed 
                intercity passenger rail corridors around the United 
                States. In addition, a Federal Railroad Administration 
                report from 2014 found that shortline and regional 
                railroads need $7 billion of investment. The Northeast 
                Corridor has a $40 billion state of good repair 
                backlog.
                    (D) A rail trust fund would provide a predictable, 
                dedicated funding source to high-speed and intercity 
                passenger rail projects and for the public benefits of 
                shortline and regional railroad freight rail projects. 
                A trust fund provides essential longer term funding 
                certainty to allow the United States to develop quality 
                intercity passenger rail service in corridors across 
                the country, eliminate the state of good repair backlog 
                on the Northeast Corridor, allow for accessible 
                equipment and stations for passengers with 
                disabilities, move more freight on rail, redevelop an 
                American passenger rail car manufacturing base, create 
                good paying, middle class jobs, and reduce our nation's 
                transportation carbon emissions.

                     TITLE IV--COMMUTER RAIL POLICY

SEC. 9401. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COMMUTER RAIL LIABILITY 
              INSURANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 32 commuter railroads 
        across the United States safely carried passengers on more than 
        500,000,000 trips each year.
            (2) Commuter rail is a $9,900,000,000 industry that creates 
        and supports more than 200,000 public- and private-sector jobs, 
        and continues to grow.
            (3) Most commuter rail agencies are required to maintain 
        liability insurance up to statutory liability limits.
            (4) Commuter rail agencies face significant obstacles to 
        finding and obtaining liability insurance.
            (5) Only a handful of insurers offer this coverage, and a 
        significant percentage of the railroad liability insurance 
        marketplace is provided by foreign companies.
            (6) The number of insurers in the American and foreign 
        markets willing to even offer potential capacity for this 
        coverage has drastically decreased over the past several years, 
        and, regardless of cost, it is becoming extremely difficult for 
        commuter railroads to obtain the needed coverage.
            (7) Despite the exceptional safety record of commuter 
        railroads and recent full compliance with positive train 
        control, a 2021 survey of the American Public Transportation 
        Association's commuter rail agencies revealed that there has 
        been a 60 percent increase in premium costs over the last 3 
        years.
            (8) The increase in premiums is largely due to factors 
        outside the control of the commuter rail industry, including 
        major forest fires, hurricanes, and insurers exiting the 
        market.
            (9) The cost of liability insurance severely impacts the 
        operating budgets of many commuter rail agencies and 
        potentially affects their ability to offer these critical 
        public transportation services.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress 
should address the capacity and cost issues associated with the 
commuter rail liability insurance market and consider establishing a 
commuter rail insurance program within the Department of 
Transportation.

SEC. 9402. SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD MEDIATION OF TRACKAGE USE 
              REQUESTS.

              requests
    ``A rail carrier shall provide good faith consideration to a 
reasonable request from a provider of commuter rail passenger 
transportation for access to trackage and provision of related 
services. If, after a reasonable period of negotiation, a public 
transportation authority cannot reach agreement with a rail carrier to 
use trackage of, and have related services provided by, the rail 
carrier for purposes of commuter rail passenger transportation, the 
public transportation authority or the rail carrier may apply to the 
Board for nonbinding mediation. In any case in which dispatching for 
the relevant trackage is controlled by a rail carrier other than the 
trackage owner, both shall be subject to the requirements of this 
section and included in the Board's mediation process. The Board shall 
conduct the nonbinding mediation in accordance with the mediation 
process of section 1109.4 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, as

reasonable. The determinations made in the preceding sentence shall 
have no effect on the nonbinding nature of the mediation.''.

SEC. 9403. SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD MEDIATION OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY USE 
              REQUESTS.

as follows:
``Sec. 28503. Surface Transportation Board mediation of rights-of-way 
              use requests
    ``A rail carrier shall provide good faith consideration to a 
reasonable request from a provider of commuter rail passenger 
transportation for access to rail right-of-way for the construction and 
operation of a segregated fixed guideway facility. If, after a 
reasonable period of negotiation, a public transportation authority 
cannot reach agreement with a rail carrier to acquire an interest in a

System'', which shall consist of National Wildlife Corridors designated 
as part of the National Wildlife Corridor System by--
            (1) statute;
            (2) rulemaking under section 11202; or
            (3) a land management plan developed or revised under 
        section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
        1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712).
    (b) Strategy.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall develop a strategy for the effective 
development of the National Wildlife Corridor System--
            (1) to support the fulfillment of the purposes described in 
        section 11202(b);

        National Wildlife Corridors; and
            (3) to develop a timeline for the implementation of 
        National Wildlife Corridors.

SEC. 15102. ADMINISTRATIVE DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL WILDLIFE CORRIDORS.

    (a) Rulemaking.--
            (1) National wildlife corridors.--Not later than 2 years 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in 
        consultation with the Secretaries, pursuant to the land, water, 
        and resource management planning and conservation authorities 
        of the Secretaries, shall establish a process, by regulation, 
        for the designation and management of National Wildlife 
        Corridors on Federal land or water under the respective 
        jurisdictions of the Secretaries. Where a National Wildlife 
        Corridor crosses federal land or water under the jurisdiction 
        of several secretaries, then the Secretary must obtain 
        concurrence from the applicable Secretaries before a National 
        Wildlife Corridor may be designated.
            (2) Federal land and water management.--The Secretaries 
        shall consider the designation of National Wildlife Corridors 
        in any process relating to the issuance, revision, or 
        modification of a management plan for land or water under the 
        respective jurisdiction of the Secretaries insofar as a 
        corridor is consistent with the purpose of the plan.
    (b) Criteria for Designation.--The regulations promulgated by the 
Secretary under subsection (a)(1) shall ensure that, in designating a 
National Wildlife Corridor, the Secretaries--

                            (ii) likely future native species habitats;
            (2) determine that the National Wildlife Corridor supports 
        the connectivity, persistence, resilience, and adaptability of 
        the native species for which it has been designated by 
        providing for--
                    (A) dispersal and genetic exchange between 
                populations;
                    (B) range shifting, range expansion, or range 
                restoration, such as in response to climate change;

                        the species naturally; or
                            (ii) to which the species may be 
                        reintroduced or restored based on habitat 
                        changes; and
            (3) is fragmented or consists of only a portion of the 
        habitat required for the connectivity needs of one or more 
        native species.
    (d) Nomination for Designation.--
            (1) In general.--In establishing the process for 
        designation under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall
